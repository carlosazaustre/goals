### Week in Review
This week I achieve my second week running 3 times, 15.3Km total. Regarding my learning objectives, I completed the *Intro to Machine Learning* course by Platzi (Very recommended) and I started the second one *Neural Networks and Backpropagation* but I haven't completed at all. I need more knowledge in Algebra, Calculus and Python before to retake, so the following week I will try to focus in this.
