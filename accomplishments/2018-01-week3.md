### Week in Review
Four weeks running 3 times each week! It is ~70Km since I started. Regarding learning objectives, I'm still following the Vue.js tutorial. It is so long and I only have a few times to dedicate over the week. I followed the Project Management Fundamentals course by Platzi in the weekend and I liked so I'm waiting for the second part in the following days.
