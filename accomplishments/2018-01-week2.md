### Week in Review
This week I run my first 10K in a good time to be my first time. Also I started the book "El Problema de los 3 cuerpos" and I continued the Vue.js tutorial.
I can't follow the online courses about Algebra and Python in this week, so I think I will start later.
Next week I will travel to Valencia for work, I will try run 3 times once week more and I will try to start the Project Management Fundamentals course.
