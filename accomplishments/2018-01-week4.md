### Week in Review
This week I travelled to Menorca, to visit GDG Menorca and to give a talk about Google Assistant and another one about Communities, GDG, WTM and another Google Developers Programs. In this week I have run only 2 times... but I have run 13 km in total. I have not time to follow reading books, I hope next week I can.
